    <h2>Will I be playing with people I don't know?</h2>
    <p>Unlike other Escape Room games, our rooms are a private experience for you, your family and friends that you invite. We know that not everyone plays well together, thus all of our games are private with no extra charge. We do this in order to ensure you have a wonderful experience and never have to be concerned with the safety of your children or friends. Unless otherwise stated, our games can be solved with 2 or more people, although when there are fewer people playing the game can be more challenging. Provided you do not give up, work together as a team and communicate, you can make a successful escape.</p>

    <h2>Are cellphones permitted in the room?</h2>
    <p>Our games do not require any outside knowledge to complete; thus you will not need your phone to look up anything. Everything needed is provided in the game. We do not permit the use of cell phone cameras and cameras in our rooms. We take pictures of your group after your gaming experience so you will have cherished memories. Use of cell phones for flashlights provides you an unfair advantage and diminishes your experience. Doing this will prevent you from being included on the leader board.</p>

    <h2>What is an Escape Game?</h2>
    <p>Have you heard of escape room games? Escape Rooms or Escape Games, are a new entertainment activity that has been popping up all over the world. What exactly are they? While the term Escape Room is how the industry started, they have become more of a puzzle solving experience. ConFundrum Escape Rooms focus on presenting fully immersive experiences that allow you, your family and friends step out of reality and into a puzzle style, real life video game. After the door closes, you will find that you have walked into a themed room. You will need to work together to search for clues to successfully solve the puzzles in order to be victorious!</p>
    <p>You are NEVER locked into our games. Unless otherwise stated, all of our games are a multi-room experience. While your game will always start in one room, there will almost always be at least 2 rooms to be experienced in the game. Can you find out how to access the additional rooms and be successful?</p>
    <p>Can you and your team enter the room, search for clues, solve riddles, and find keys to solve the theme before the clock runs out? You will have one hour to work with your team to find the tools necessary to succeed. There are no specific skills required to participate in our games; your team will need people with the power of observation and critical thinking skills in order to win.</p>
    <p>Booking an escape game with your friends or family members is a fantastic way to work together and build bonds through a one of a kind experience. You will see each player use their individual skills to contribute to the team’s success! You may even learn something about your loved ones that you did not already know. Whether you come for a birthday party, family reunion, or just a rainy day, our games will help you make memories with that you will talk about for years to come. Our games also make fun times for bachelor and bachelorette parties! Change your normal routine and instead of watching TV and participate in an exciting and thrilling activity with your friends or family.</p>

    <h2>I'd like to schedule a special event or team building even. Is this possible?</h2>
    <p>Absolutely! Please contact us to discuss the details. Corporate events are always welcome and easily arranged. We happily schedule outside of our normal operating hours to accommodate groups of 8 or larger with notice. This is probably NOT a good option for a young child's birthday party (see above regarding recommended ages), but we have had many pre-teen/teen birthday parties at our venue and this is a very fun event. Unfortunately, we do not have cake/party rooms available.</p>

    <h2>How many people are needed for each room? Is there a max capacity?</h2>
    <p>Each room will have a different minimum and a maximum number of players. The number of players is determined by how many people are required to solve one or more of the puzzles and the maximum number of players is determined by room size and the number of puzzles. We never want someone to feel left out because they don’t have anything to do. We also don’t want the room too crowded.</p>
    <p>Most of our rooms have a max capacity of either 8 or 10 people. But we recommend 4-6 for each room to have the best experience.</p>
