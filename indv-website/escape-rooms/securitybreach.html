<h1>Hacker House</h1>
<p>You are a member of a successful crime syndicate, and your specialty has always been safe cracking. Today, you’ll be facing your greatest challenge yet, as you and your team attempt a heist at the New Wealth Bank.

Your recon team has just completed phase one of the heist – they have ensured the building is empty and gained access to the bank manager’s office, where the door to the vault awaits. They have assessed the situation and have reported that this particular vault is going to be difficult to compromise. They have discreetly hidden clues, tools and hints around the office which you will need to complete your job as safe cracker.
    
If you do manage to enter the vault, you will have to make a crucial decision: take the available money and run, or stay just a little longer to try to significantly increase your take.</p>
