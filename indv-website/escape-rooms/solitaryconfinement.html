<h1>The Lunatic Down on 4th Street</h1>
<p>You have been going crazy for months in Mr. Turner's soundproof cell. He has been keeping you there, like he is your treasure, and wants no one else to have you. Now you have came up with the perfect plan to break out, again, before dinnertime comes around. However, because you have done this so many times in the past, some of the people locked in with you have straightjackets on for a safety reason. Can you and your team get out of the jackets, solve the security puzzles, and get out before he come back? Lets find out.</p>
