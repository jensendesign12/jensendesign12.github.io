<h1>Fees/Costs</h1>
<p>Our rooms all have a minimum of 2 rooms to each experience and the level of decoration and immersion is above standard for the area. If you’ve played other escape rooms, you’ve undoubtedly run into rooms that are just a series of lock boxes and have little or no decoration. We have gone to great lengths and expenses to ensure you actually feel like you are in the theme. Our fees are standard with the national average.</p>

    <p>We realize that these games can become an expensive addiction and thus provide prices for all ages.</p>

    <p>Our costs are:</p>
