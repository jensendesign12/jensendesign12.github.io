<h1>Our Awesome Reviews!</h1>
<h3>"The serial killer room is definitely worth it. Itâ€™s intense, spooky, and challenging. <br> The overall experience was thrilling and tested your critical thinking skills. Having to get into the mind of a serial killer<br> was exhilarating and I will definitely be returning to take on the other rooms. 10/10 would recommend." -Jasmine</h3>

<h3>"So much fun! We've done two of their three rooms, and both were equally awesome! <br>We have also done an escape room in Provo (it was $18/person) and a really popular one in SLC ($30/person) and even though the <br>were more expensive, they paled in comparison to the one here in Rexburg, which is just $10 per person. I definitely recommend it to everyone. Can't wait to do the third room!" - Anders</h3>

<h3>"Fun and cheap! We all enjoyed the staircase room and would highly recommend it to anyone. <br>I think my 5 year old could have helped out in some ways even. It was great for all ages and puzzle abilities. <br>Everyone was able to contribute in our group and we had a fun time working together. Great experience!" - Jessica</h3>
